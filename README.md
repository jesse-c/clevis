# Clevis

The big linker.

Generation, vs linking, is preferable. If you can't generate, then link. Linking infers having manually created something, and manual creation is generally more work intensive and error prone, as opposed to running generationâ€”in the areas that this project covers, as opposed to things like code generation.
